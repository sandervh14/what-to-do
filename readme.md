# Tell me what to do

Sometimes you have a bit of time to do something, but for some reason you can't decide on what to do.

This little tool comes to the rescue!

It is as simple as:
1. Personalize `options.txt` with the activities you see yourself possibly doing in a next moment of indecisivness.
2. Roll the dice! Run `python tell_me.py` in this folder and let your computer decide randomly what you'll do. Decision made! Now go do it.

No more than 3 times re-rolling the dice! Or you'll never do anything.
If you find yourself rolling the dice for the third time, the activity the dice decides, is the one you'll do for sure!

If doing step 2 does not work on your computer, it is probably because you don't have python installed. You can install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

You can store your activities in a different file than `options.txt`, or create multiple files, dedicated to the moment you'll run the dice (`weekend.txt` or `weekday.txt`, for example.), your mood in the moment (`angry.txt` or `happy.txt`, for example), and so on.
To roll the dice with a different activities file, run `python tell_me.py weekend.txt`.
